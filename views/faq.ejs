          <p>Numerology has ancient roots that can be traced back to several civilizations including Babylonia, ancient Egypt, ancient China, and ancient India.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>In Indian culture, numerology (known as "Ank Shastra" in Hindi) has been practiced for thousands of years and is closely tied to Vedic astrology (Jyotish). It is often used in naming ceremonies, determining auspicious dates for important events, and understanding one's destiny. Many Indian families consult numerologists for naming their children, businesses, and even for selecting house numbers that will bring positive energy.</p>

          <span class="faq-toggle"><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The core numbers in numerology include: Life Path Number (derived from birth date), Destiny/Expression Number (derived from full birth name), Soul Urge/Heart's Desire Number (derived from vowels in name), Personality Number (derived from consonants in name), and Birth Day Number (the day of the month you were born). Each of these numbers reveals different aspects of your character and life journey.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The Life Path Number is calculated by reducing your full birth date to a single digit (or master number). For example, if you were born on September 15, 1985, you would calculate: 9 (month) + 1+5 (day) + 1+9+8+5 (year) = 38. Then reduce: 3+8 = 11. Since 11 is a master number, you can keep it as 11, or further reduce: 1+1 = 2. Your Life Path Number would be 11/2.</p>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Master numbers in numerology are 11, 22, and 33. These numbers are not reduced to a single digit because they are considered to have special significance and power.

          <p>For most numerology calculations, your birth name (the name given to you at birth) is used to calculate your Destiny/Expression Number, Soul Urge Number, and Personality Number as these relate to your inherent qualities and life purpose.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Western numerology (Pythagorean system) assigns numbers 1-9 to letters in a specific pattern (A=1, B=2, etc.) and focuses on birth date and name analysis. Vedic numerology (Chaldean system), commonly practiced in India, assigns numbers based on sound vibrations, uses 1-8 (with 9 considered divine), and incorporates more spiritual elements. Vedic numerology also places greater emphasis on name correction and remedial measures to enhance positive energies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>In Vedic (Chaldean) numerology, letters are assigned values: 1 (A, I, J, Q, Y), 2 (B, K, R), 3 (C, G, L, S), 4 (D, M, T), 5 (E, H, N, X), 6 (U, V, W), 7 (O, Z), and 8 (F, P). Add the values of all letters in your name and reduce to a single digit unless it's 11, 22, or 33. For example, "AMIT" would be 1+4+1+4=10, which reduces to 1.
